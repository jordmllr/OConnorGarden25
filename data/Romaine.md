## 🌱 Planting Guidelines

### Starting Seeds Indoors

- **When**: Early to mid March.
- **How**: Sow seeds in flats, spacing them about ½ inch apart. Once seedlings are 5 inches tall, clip the tops to encourage strong growth.
- **Transplanting**: Harden off seedlings before moving them outdoors in late April to early May.

### Direct Sowing

- **When**: Late April to early May, after soil has warmed.
- **Spacing**: Sow seeds ¼ inch deep and 1 inch apart in rows 12 inches apart. Thin to 6 inches apart once seedlings are established.

*Romaine lettuce is challenging to grow in North Dakota due to its longer maturity period. Starting seeds indoors and transplanting is the best approach.*
